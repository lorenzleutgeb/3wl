\chapter{Propagation for lazy-grounding Answer Set solving}

This chapter contextualizes propagation by providing definitions extending chapter \ref{chap:preliminaries}. It then presents and thoroughly explains the algorithms and data structures involved in propagation and concludes in a proof of soundness and completeness thereof.

\section{Definitions}

% Signed literal vs. boolean signed literal.

Following definitions lay out the vocabulary and concepts towards an explanation of unit propagation. Most of them fundamentally depend on \emph{atoms} (usually denoted $v$) but do not refer to neither a set of atoms nor their domain. This is because all definitions are bound to a logic program $P$ to be solved (i.e.~to find answer sets for). The set of ground atoms wrt.~$P$, effectively its Herbrand Base $\textit{HB}(P)$, is obtained by the grounding process, which is not detailed in this work. What might seem to be lacking from the definitions therefore is the context of the input program $P$ and therefore the domain of atoms. $P$ and its context is omitted in the following.

% TODO: Where does v come from? Should be in some HB(P)?
%\begin{definition}
%A \emph{ground atom} (or simply \emph{atom}) wrt.~a logic program $P$ is an element of $\textit{HB}(P)$, usually denoted $v$.
%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}
A \emph{signed literal} $\sgl$ of the form $\bT v$, $\bM v$ or $\bF v$ where $v$ is an atom and $\bT v$ expresses that $v$ is \emph{true}, $\bM v$ that it \emph{must be true}, and $\bF v$ that it is \emph{false}.
%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}
A \emph{boolean signed literal} $\bsgl$ of the form $\bT v$ or $\bF v$ where $v$ is an atom and  $\bT v$ expresses that $v$ is \emph{true}, and $\bF v$ that it is \emph{false}.
%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}
%The function $\wkn(\bsgl)$ takes a boolean signed literal $\bsgl$ and transforms it into a signed literal referred to as its \emph{weak form}, meaning that while \emph{false} stays \emph{false}, e.g.~$\wkn(\bF v) = \bF v$, \emph{true} is mapped to \emph{\mbt}, e.g.~$\wkn(\bT v) = \bM v$.
%\end{definition}

% TODO: Remark on boolean signed literal vs. signed literal with context of clasp?

\begin{definition}
An \emph{assignment} $\ass$ is a sequence $(\sgl_1, \ldots, \sgl_n)$ of signed literals $\sgl_i$ of the form $\bX v_i$ with $\bX \in \thrice$ where $v_i \not = v_j$ for $1 \leq i < j \leq n$, or \emph{conflict}.
%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}
For every assignment, a respective \emph{boolean assignment}, denoted $\bass(\ass)$ can be constructed by collapsing all atoms that \emph{must be true} to being \emph{true}:$$\bass(\ass) = \{ \sgl \in \ass \ | \ \sgl = \bT v \textrm{ or } \sgl = \bF v \} \cup \{ \bM v \ | \ \bT v \in \ass \}$$
\end{definition}

%\begin{remark}
Below, assignments are sometimes also used as sets, in which case the set represented by some assignment is simply the set of all signed literals contained in the sequence.
%\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Strong complement, denoted by $\negstrong{\sgl}$, and weak complement, $\negweak{\sgl}$, mapping $\bF v$ to $\bT v$ and $\bF v$ to $\bM v$ respectively, of a signed literal are defined by the following truth table:%equalities: $\negstrong{\bT v} = \bF v$, $\negstrong{\bM v} = \bF v$ and  $\negstrong{\bF v} = \bT v$, while $\negweak{\bT v} = \bF v$, $\negweak{\bM v} = \bF v$ and $\negweak{\bF v} = \bM v$.
% "andere Richtung auch erklären"

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|cc|}
\hline
$\sgl$&$\negstrong{\sgl}$&$\negweak{\sgl}$\\
\hline
\hline
$\bT v$&$\bF v$&$\bF v$\\
$\bM v$&$\bF v$&$\bF v$\\
$\bF v$&$\bT v$&$\bM v$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

The assignment obtained by appending the literal $\sgl$ to $\ass$ is denoted by $\ass \circ \sigma$. In case $\negstrong{\sigma} \in \ass \vee \negweak{\sigma} \in \ass$ however, $\ass \circ \sigma =$ \emph{conflict} to indicate that appending $\sigma$ conflicts with other literals in $\ass$. Furthermore $\emph{conflict} \circ \sigma = \emph{conflict}$. To ensure that the assignment contains at most one literal per atom $v$, in case $\bM v \in \ass$, then $\bM v$ is removed when before $\bT v$.

\begin{definition}
An atom $v$ is \emph{unassigned} with respect to some assignment $\ass$ iff $$\ass \cap \{\bT v, \bM v, \bF v \} = \emptyset$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A signed literal $\bX v$ with $\bX \in \thrice$ is \emph{unassigned} wrt.~$\ass$ if $v$ is unassigned wrt.~$\ass$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{nogood} reflects a partial assignment that cannot be extended to a solution. Here, a \emph{nogood} is a set $\{ \bsgl_1, \ldots, \bsgl_n \}$ of signed literals.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A nogood $\delta$ is \emph{violated} by an assignment $\ass$ if $\delta \subseteq \bass(\ass)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A nogood $\delta$ is \emph{satisfied} wrt.~some assignment $\ass$ iff there is no $\ass' \supseteq \ass$ s.t.~$\delta$ is violated under $\ass'$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A nogood is \emph{strictly unit} with respect to some assignment $\ass$ iff it contains exactly one \emph{unassigned} literal and all other literals are elements of $\ass$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A nogood is \emph{weakly unit} with respect to some assignment $\ass$ iff it contains exactly one \emph{unassigned} literal and all other literals are \emph{weak} elements of $\ass$.
\end{definition}

%To efficiently retrieve the set of nogoods that need to be checked for unity, a data structure of watches was 

A watch structure is a set $\Delta = \{ (v_1, W_1), \ldots, (v_n, W_n) \}$ of pairs $(v_i, W_i)$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, containing an atom $v_i$ and a triple $W_i = (W_i^+, W_i^-, W_i^\alpha)$, referred to as the \emph{watches for $v_i$}, consisting of three sets of nogoods that potentially propagate in case the assignment of $v$ changes from \emph{unassigned} to \emph{true} or \emph{\mbt} ($W_i^+$) or from \emph{unassigned} to \emph{false} ($W_i^-$), or from \emph{\mbt} to \emph{true} ($W_i^\alpha$). Also there are no two pairs $(v, W), (v', W') \in \Delta$ s.t.~$v = v'$, i.e.~$\Delta$ is a function mapping an atom to a triple of its watches. We write $\Delta(v) = W$ to denote $(v, W) \in \Delta$. Furthermore, let $\Delta^\pm(\sgl) = W^+$ for $\sgl$ of $\bT v$ or $\bM v$ and $\Delta^\pm(\sgl) = W^-$ for $\sgl$ of $\bF v$ with $W^+$ and $W^-$ from $\Delta(v)$, i.e.~for signed literals, $\Delta^\pm$ is a function that yields the watches according polarity of the literal. Lastly, for some $\sgl = \bX v$ or an atom $v$, let $\Delta^\alpha(v) = W^\alpha$ with $W^\alpha$ via $\Delta(v)$.

A nogood $\delta$ is said to be \welf wrt.~some watch structure $\Delta$ and an assignment $\ass$ if the following four statements hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta$ is not violated by $\ass$.
\item $\delta$ is not unit wrt.~$\ass$.
\item If $\delta$ is not satisfied and contains at least two unassigned literals $\bsgl_1, \bsgl_2, \ldots \in \delta$, then $\delta$ is contained in exactly two watches, e.g. $\delta \in \Delta^\pm(\bsgl_1)$ and $\delta \in \Delta^\pm(\bsgl_2)$ with $\bsgl_1 \not = \bsgl_2$.
\item Let $L_\delta = \{ \bT v \in \text{body}(\delta) \ | \ \bT v \not \in \ass \}$. If $L_\delta \not = \emptyset$, then there is exactly one $\bsgl \in L_\delta$ with $\delta \in \Delta^\alpha(\bsgl)$.
\end{enumerate}

A watch structure $\Delta$ is said to be \welf wrt.~some assignment $\ass$ in case all nogoods $\delta \in \Delta$ are well formed wrt.~$\Delta$ and $\ass$.

Algorithm \ref{alg:upu} exhibits how unit propagation is used to infer assignments (of either false or \mbt) from watched nogoods. 
In line 1, the input literal $\sgl$ is transformed to its weak form as lookups in $\Delta$ are always made against the set of nogoods that might propagate in case the literal \mbt, even if $\sgl$ is of $\bT x$. % Why?
In the loop spanning from line 2-13 all nogoods that are to be checked for propagation according to $\Delta$ are iterated. For any such nogood one of the following three cases holds true
\begin{enumerate}
\item it is violated, leading to the algorithm immediately returning the conflicting assignment, or
\item it is weakly unit, in which case a new assignment can be inferred from the nogood, or
\item in any other case, there must be at least two unassigned literals in $\delta$, which are to be watched for changes in assignments.
% TODO: Does not (1.) and not (2.) guarantee that there are two unassigned literals?! Nogood could be satisfied.
\end{enumerate}

In case (3.), $\Delta$ is modified in lines 8-11. As $\sgl$ is now assigned, it should not be watched for changes anymore. This is achieved by removing $\delta$ from the set of watches $\Delta(\sgl)$ and instead adding it to the set of watches for two unassigned literals in $\delta$.

For every nogood $\delta \in \Delta$, if $\delta$ contains at least two atoms unassigned under $\ass$, then $\delta$ is contained in exactly two watch lists.
%TODO define watch list!

\begin{theorem}
Algorithm \ref{alg:up} is sound, i.e.~given an assignment $\ass$, a watch structure $\Delta$ \welf wrt.~$\ass$ and a new assignment $\sgl$, the following three statements hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\sgl$ does not conflict with $\ass$ and there are any assignments that can be inferred by unit propagation, these assignments are generated and the return value is an extended assignment $\ass' = \ass \circ \sgl$ and a watch structure $\Delta'$ \welf under $\ass'$.
\item If $\sgl$ conflicts with $\ass$, the conflicting assignment is returned and the returned watch structure is $\Delta$.
\item 
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item in case $\sgl$ conflicts with $\ass$, the algorithm will return the assignment \emph{conflict} and $\Delta$ is not guaranteed to be well formed,
\item otherwise, the resulting watch structure $\Delta$ will be well formed wrt. the resulting assignment $\ass$.
\end{enumerate}

(1.) is trivial, as $\ass$ will be assigned \emph{conflict} in line 1 of the algorithm in case $\sgl$ conflicts with any other assignment in $\ass$.

We show that for a watch structure $\Delta$ that is \welf wrt.~an assignment $\ass$, the watch structure $\Delta'$ and assignment $\ass'$ returned from Algorithm \ref{alg:up} is well formed as well.

In line 1 of algorithm \ref{alg:up}, $\ass$ is altered by appending the given signed literal $\sgl$. Now, $\Delta$ might not be well formed wrt.~the altered assignment $\ass'$ anymore, because there might be some nogood $\delta \in \Delta^\pm(\sgl)$. By executing algorithm \ref{alg:upu}, $\Delta$ is transformed into a well formed watch structure $\Delta'$.
Show that the algorithm infers a non-conflicting assignment from a non-conflicting assignment.

We show that every nogood $\delta \in \Delta'$ is \welf wrt.~$\Delta'$ and $\ass'$, i.e.~$\Delta'$ is \welf wrt.~$\ass'$, by using that $\Delta$ is \welf wrt.~$\ass$ and the definition of the algorithm.

For every nogood $\delta \in \Delta$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\sgl \not \in \delta$, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta$ is not violated by $\ass'$ because it is not violated by $\ass$ and the nogood cannot be violated by assigning $\sgl$ as $\sgl \not \in \delta$.
\item $\delta$ is not unit, analogous to (b): $\delta$ is not unit wrt.~$\ass$ and it is not unit wrt.~$\ass'$ because $\ass' = \ass \circ \sgl$ and $\sgl \not \in \delta$.
\item If $\delta$ contains at least two unassigned literals $\bsgl_1, \bsgl_2, \ldots$ wrt.~$\ass$ it will contain at least two unassigned literals wrt.~$\ass'$ as well, because $\sgl \not \in \delta$. The algorithm does neither modify $\Delta^\pm(\bsgl_1)$ nor $\Delta^\pm(\bsgl_2)$ (it only modifies $\Delta(\sgl)$), so the same $\bsgl_1, \bsgl_2$ satisfy $\delta \in \Delta^\pm(\bsgl_1)$ and $\delta \in \Delta^\pm(\bsgl_2)$ with $\bsgl_1 \not = \bsgl_2$ for $\ass$ and $\ass'$.
\item Analogous to (c), if $\delta$ has any triggers, their assignment does not change, as $\sgl \not \in \delta$, and no watches $\delta \in \Delta^\alpha(\bsgl)$ are changed. The same $\bsgl$ will satisfy $\delta \in \Delta^\alpha(\bsgl)$ for $\ass$ and $\ass'$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Else:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\delta \not \in \Delta^\pm(\sgl)$, i.e.~$\delta$ was not watched on $\sgl$, then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta$ is not violated, because there must be some 
\item $\Delta^\pm(\sgl)$ is unchanged
\end{enumerate}
\item Else:
\begin{enumerate}
\item violated $\to$ conflict
\item weakly unit $\to$ satisfied
\item pointer move $\to$ two unassigned literals
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Algorithm \ref{alg:up} is complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Indirect proof, showing that if there is an assignment that results from propagation it will be generated.
